At the beginning of the game, you need to choose your player image by type in correct name of each image. Any name that
is not found in the folder will be replaced with Bob, i.e. the image will use the char-boy.png

In the next step, you need to choose the level of the game from Easy, Normal and Hard. The default level is Normal. This
level will set the speed of the enemy. The Easy level will have the slowest enemy in the game.

In each round, your score begins with zero; Your goal is to reach the bank of the river, then you will be transmitted back
to the start point. When you succeed in arriving at the bank, your score will increase by 1. If you got hit or came across
an enemy, you will be transmitted back to the start point with score minus one.

Good Luck!
